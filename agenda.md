H. C. Andersens Boulevard 44-46,

DK 1553 Copenhagen V,

Denmark

## Description

__Objectives__

__Presentations__
  
  * Helen Ogden 
    * Checking the quality of Laplace-approximate inference 
   
__Possible Topics__
   
   * Discuss with TMB developers to add spatial-temporal tools into ADMB (Requested by Mark Maunder).
   
   * Presentation on TINY_AD (proposed by John Sibert).
     * Using TINY_AD to improve ADMB code base.
     * Using TINY_AD to improve existing ADMB applications. Possible breakout session.
   
   * Improvements to MCMC functionality
     * Demonstrate stable versions of NUTS for TMB and ADMB and how they compare to Stan.
     * What can go wrong and how to fix it (focus on stock assessments). Try on some real models.
     * Discuss next steps (if any).
        
   * Priotizing avenues for statistical improvement
     * Variational methods
     * Using MCMC instead of Importance Sampling with fixed seed to replace Laplace approximation
     * Incorporating generalized hypergeometric function (for N-mixture model)
   
   * Prioritizing computational improvements
     * Low-memory bias-correction
     * GPU testing for different operating systems
